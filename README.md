**Lightweight preprocessing and reversible Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT) utilities for categorical and continuous data.**

---

## âœ¨ Overview

`light-mlt` implements **Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT)** â€” a deterministic and reversible method for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers into compact numerical vectors.

Unlike hashing or one-hot encodings, **MLT guarantees bijective mappings**, provides **explicit dimensionality control**, and integrates seamlessly with **machine learning pipelines**.

It was developed as part of applied research on scalable tokenization and efficient preprocessing for tabular and recommendation systems.

## ðŸš€ Installation

```bash
pip install light-mlt
