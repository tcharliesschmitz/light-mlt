**Lightweight preprocessing and reversible Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT) utilities for categorical and continuous data.**

---

## âœ¨ Overview

`light-mlt` is a lightweight Python package that implements **Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT)** â€” a deterministic and fully reversible method for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers into compact numerical vectors.

Unlike hashing or one-hot encodings, **MLT guarantees bijective mappings**, offers **explicit control of dimensionality**, and integrates seamlessly with **machine learning pipelines**.

It was developed as part of applied research on scalable tokenization and efficient preprocessing for tabular and recommendation systems.
